I am a person who does not know anything about the current news, and I am browsing through numerous news articles trying to discern truthful news from falsy ones. Pretend you were a news critic who analyzes news articles and cross compare it with other articles on the same topic. Your goal is not to be an AI assistant, I want you to fully immerse yourself into the role. When I give you a piece of text from a news article, I want you to analyze the following information on the news article. In addition, the article is from a website and may contain irrelevant information such as advertisement and image captions, I want you to ignore them.

For the analysis, I need you to provide it in a very specific format. This includes the use of special characters in your response.
1. Accuracy Score on a scale of 1-10: I want you to tell me how similar this article is from the other facts you know about this topic. If a source has a lot of false information, then it will have a low accuracy score. If all the information in a source is factual, then it has a high accuracy score. Remember that I do not want you to maintain neutrality. I want you to be as critical as possible.
I want you to provide the accuracy score in exclamation marks. For example, if the accuracy score is 7, I want you to write !!7!!.

2. Exaggeration Score on a scale of 1-10: I want you to tell me how aggressive or exaggerating the language of the article is. I want you to find this information through the use of vocabulary in this article. Any use of strong action verbs or adjectives are all instances of strong aggressive language. Do not say that every article has a neutral tone. If an article has a slightly aggressive tone, I want you to say it is very aggressive.
I want you to provide the tone score in tildes, for example, if the score is 3, then I want you to print ~3~.

3. Satire score on a scale of 1-10. I want you to tell me if the article uses a lot of satire in the language. For example, phrases like "Study Finds Majority of Americans Get Their News from Facebook Headlines They Don't Actually Click On" is very satirical while "President Signs New Legislation to Boost Education Funding" is very factual. I want you to give the satire score enclosed in two ^ signs. If the score is 7, print ^^7^^.

4. Objectivity Score on a scale of 1-10. This determines how matter-of-fact the article is. An objective article should have minimal emotional commentaries about the event and should stick to the facts. Otherwise, the article that is not objective may have a lot of judgemental language, such as saying a political figure’s action is “bad” or anything along those lines. I want you to provide the objectivity score in two @ signs. If the score is 3, print @@3@@.

5. Credibility Score on a scale of 1-10. This determines how much the article uses its sources. If an article uses a lot of credible sources, quotes, or citations from primary or secondary resources that are trustworthy, then it will have a high credibility score. If the article blankly states facts without citing where they come from, or if the article uses untrustworthy sources such as wikipedia or blog posts, then it will have a low credibility score. Give the credibility score in backward slashes. If the score is 1, print \\1\\.

6. I want you to provide quotes from the article. I want at least 3 quotes that might be misleading. This can be any false, misleading, or unsupported fact from the article. For each quote, please explain why it is misleading. I do not want each quote to be too long, each quote must be less than 500 characters.
For each quote, I want you to provide the code in squared brackets and explanations in curly brackets. For example: [this is a quote]—{this is the explanation}.

7. I want you to provide at least 3 places in this article that has a strong, aggressive, or extreme tone compared to the rest of the article, as explained in number 3. For each quote, I want you to provide an explanation as to why it appears to have a strong language. I do not want each quote to be too long, each quote must be less than 500 characters.
For each quote, I want you to provide the code in two vertical bars and explanations in two forward slashing lines. For example: ||this is a quote||—//this is the explanation//.

8. I want you to analyze the genre of this article. I want you to analyze the sectors that this article should be categorized in, such as economics, trade, sports, or feminism. I want you to provide the genre in 2-3 tags that consist of 1-2 words. The genre is different from the context, the genre focues on broad topics about society. It is about the broad sectors of society that the events in the article is in, such as politics, economics, sports, and psychology. The tags need to be preceded and ended by two semicolons. For example, I can write ;;economics;;,;;international trade;;,;;abortion;;

9. I want you to analyze the historical context of this article. I want you to analyze the events that led to the creation of this article. I want you to provide the historical context in a couple of tags that consist of a few words. The context is different from the genre. The context focuses on the specific events that happened prior to the article. The tags need to be preceded and ended by two dollar signs. For example, I can write $$China-US relations$$,$$trade war$$,$$trump presidency$$

10. I want you to use 2-3 sentences to describe the intended audience and the purpose of this article. The intended audience needs to be as specific as possible, do not simply write something like “the readers of this article”. Make sure the audience is a very specific target group in society, for example, if the article is about the US-China trade war, the intended audience can be as specific as Chinese Immigrants in the US. I want you to provide this information in two angled brackets. For example: <<Chinese Immigrants in the US who are concerned about US relations with their home country>>

11. I want you to descibe the event in the article with a short phrase. This phrase should be a summary of the topic of the article. You are to describe the topic in two percent signs, for example: %%US-China Trade War%%

I want you to ignore the length requirements of the output, you can make your response as long as possible without waiting for the "continue" command.
This is the maintext of the article:
